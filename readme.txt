--Readme document for Fiona Zou, xixianz1@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else's code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- Multiple images with descriptive alt attributes (profile photos, project screenshots)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text throughout all pages
- External links to LinkedIn, email, and project documentation (Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Slides)
- Multiple pages (index.html, about.html, projects.html, contact.html) with navigation between them
- Semantic HTML tags including <nav>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <aside>
- Custom icons from Font Awesome throughout the site

(b) CSS features
- Modified padding and margins extensively to create visual hierarchy and enhance readability
- Custom color scheme with orange (#f6ad55) as primary accent color, dark gray (#2d3748) for text and backgrounds
- Custom fonts from Google Fonts (Inter font family with multiple weights)
- Advanced layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- Gradient backgrounds on hero section
- Box shadows and border radius for modern card-based design

(c) Advanced features
- Complex multi-column page layouts with sidebar navigation and content sections
- Responsive navigation bar that adapts to mobile screens
- Contact form with multiple input types (text, email, select dropdown, textarea) and validation
- Nested CSS selectors for specific styling of components
- Smooth scroll animations using Intersection Observer API
- Interactive hover effects and transitions throughout
- Back-to-top button functionality
- Grid-based project showcase with alternating layouts


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

Yes, I ignored the "i (italic) element used" warnings. These <i> tags are 
not used for italic text, but rather to display Font Awesome icons, which 
is the standard implementation method for this icon library. The icons are 
purely decorative and do not convey essential information - all important 
links also have descriptive aria-labels or text labels for screen readers.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Approximately 12-14 hours total, including:
- Planning and designing the layout (1 hours)
- Building HTML structure for all four pages (3 hours)
- Creating and refining CSS styles (2 hours)
- Adding JavaScript interactivity (2 hours)
- Testing responsiveness across different screen sizes (2 hours)
- Running validation checks and fixing issues (2 hours)
- Final refinements and content updates (1 hour)


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

- Font Awesome (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css)
  For icons throughout the site

- Google Fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/)
  Inter font family for typography

- MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/)
  Referenced for CSS Grid, Flexbox, and HTML semantic elements
  Intersection Observer API documentation

- CSS-Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/)
  Grid layout examples
  Responsive design patterns

- W3C Validators (https://validator.w3.org/)
  HTML and CSS validation


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I worked independently on this assignment and did not consult with classmates.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No special setup required. The portfolio is a static website that can be opened directly in any modern web browser.
